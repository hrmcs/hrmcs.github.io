									</header>

									<p><a href="index.html" class="logo"><strong>H R M </strong></a>’s tuition is designed to fund high level educational and program opportunities, 
									hire and retain talented faculty and staff, 
									and maintain a campus that will enhance the experience of all learners, ultimately preparing each individual for college and for life in a 
									global environment. Our hope is to give as many students as possible the chance to experience HRM’s curriculum, 
									global community, and collegiate campus, while maintaining the small class sizes that enhance each child’s experience and relationships with peers
									and faculty. When HRM’s tuition can provide so much, we hope it also will not hinder opportunities; therefore, each year we work closely with
									applicants and returning students to provide impactful financial assistance awards enabling them to attend HRM.
									</P>

                                       HRM offers a need-based financial assistance program for qualifying students in grades 1–8. Due to the limited number of spaces in Early Childhood 
                                         we are unable to offer financial assistance until students enter first grade. Applying for financial assistance at HRM is a simple process. Assistance is based on the 
                                          financial need established through a third party called Financial Aid for School Tuition (FAST).This is a CONFIDENTIAL PROGRAM and only the Financial Assistance Committee will 
											review your personal financial records or know of any award granted. All financial assistance awards come directly from HRM operating budget. HRM does not receive any 
												funds from the government or outside resources to support those families applying for financial assistance.In this current economic climate, it is important for you to know that we 
													have a large number of applicants to consider. With a limited amount of funds we will need to be very careful with distribution of monies available as we try to help as many students 
														as possible benefit from a HRM education. Therefore, it is important that families complete and submit all required documents in a timely manner to be considered.
